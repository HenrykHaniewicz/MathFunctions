# Multi-language mathematical functions

I AM NOT AN AMAZING PROGRAMMER AND THIS IS A SIDE PROJECT SO I WELCOME PULL REQUESTS! :D

Simple ports for math functions for a variety of different languages (but currently just C++ and Python). The aim of this little project is to be able to initialize these functions in code in pretty much the same way for the same results no matter what language (that I know how to code in) is required.

## Getting Started

It is first useful to clone the git from the main folder so that you have access to all the different packages. However, if you required only one such package (one language), you can clone from the folder named after that particular language.

### Prerequisites

C++ branch:

```
gcc (7 or higher)
g++ (6 or higher)
std=c++17
```

Python branch:

```
python 3.X (with all standard libraries)
numpy 1.15
```

### Installing

Coming soon...
